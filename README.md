# Forest-fire-alert-system- 

**AIM**- To detect forest fires in deep forests and send alert signals to prevent loss of vegetation and wildlife. 

(Based on the forest inventory records, 54.40% of forests in India are exposed to occasional fires, 7.49% to moderately frequent fires and 2.40% to high incidence levels while 35.71% of Indiaâ€™s forests have not yet been exposed to fires of any real significance. According to the details shared by the minister, the number of forest-fire alerts between November 2019 and June 2020 was 1,24,473. This was possible because of the forest fire alert systems that are in place. There are many other forests where this system is yet to be installed in.)

**Procedure**- 

Step 1: At first, we connect the NodeMCU to the breadboard. Then we make the connections accordingly.

Step 2:  We connect the pins of NodeMCU with those of the flame sensor, MQ2 gas sensor and buzzer.

Step 3:  We use resistors in between the connections and LEDs too.

Step 4:  We download the necessary libraries for running the code on Arduino.

Step 5: We integrate our project with the Blynk app to make it accessible easily.

Step 6:  We upload the code on the Arduino IDE into the NodeMCU by connecting them through a Micro USB data cable.

Step 7: Now, we have the system ready and in place. When the sensors are triggered upon detection of fire, an alert message is sent to the authorities to bring the situation under control easily.

The system uses a flame sensor to detect fire. The unique feature of this system is that it receives a push notification to your smartphone in the event of a fire at the connected location. Further version of the project include using MQ2, MQ6 sensors and a communication system to send mails and messages to the authorities.
